# ðŸ§  Bull Put Spread Monte Carlo Simulator

This project is a browser-based simulation of a **Bull Put Spread strategy** using Monte Carlo methods, implemented with **HTML + JavaScript + Chart.js**.

It allows users to input key option parameters and visualize:
- Simulated stock price evolution
- Value of individual put options
- Net profit/loss of the Bull Put Spread
- Distribution histogram of strategy outcomes
- Summary statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probability of loss

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

No installation required.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Black-Scholes approximation for option value

## ðŸ§® Financial Logic
The simulation assumes:
- Log-normal stock price evolution using Geometric Brownian Motion
- Final intrinsic value of sold/bought puts
- Profit = Net premium received - option payoff at expiry

## ðŸ“· Screenshots
(Include a screenshot of the app after running a simulation.)

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
This project is part of my portfolio demonstrating practical skills in:
- Financial derivatives
- Front-end interactivity
- Quantitative finance & simulation

Iâ€™m currently transitioning from a telecommunications engineering role to finance and fintech, with a focus on algorithmic trading and quantitative research.
